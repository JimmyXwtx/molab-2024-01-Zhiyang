# Research on Deafblind Communication Tools

This project focuses on the development and sharing of innovative communication tools designed for the deafblind community. 

This week, I concentrated on researching the most effective communication methods and technologies.

## Communication Methods

Deafblind individuals use a variety of communication methods based on their specific sensory capabilities. Below are some of the primary methods identified through academic research:

### Tactile Methods
- **Tactile Sign Language**: Allows deafblind individuals to feel the signs through touch. [Janssen & Rødbroe, "Tactile Signing for People Who Are Deaf-Blind"]
- **Deafblind Manual Alphabet**: Involves spelling letters onto the person’s hand.
- **Braille**: Employs raised dots that are readable through touch.

### Technological Aids
- **Refreshable Braille Displays**: These devices convert text from digital devices into braille for tactile reading. [Romero-Rey & Herrera, "Technological Aids for the Deafblind"]
- **Screen Readers**: Software that vocalizes text displayed on a computer screen.

### Hybrid Methods
- **Speech and Lip-reading**: Utilized by those who have retained partial hearing and vision.
- **Print on Palm**: Involves writing words directly on the palm.
- **Visual Frame Signing**: Signing within the limited visual field of the individual.

## Tools and Technologies

This section outlines tools and technologies that support communication for the deafblind community:

- **Braille Displays**
- **Assistive Apps**: Designed to convert speech to text or braille and vice versa.
- **Vibratory Alert Devices**: Use vibrations to convey messages or alerts.
